st.write('One of the key features of my apps is their ability to connect to custom data sources. This means that you can upload your own PDFs, PPTX files, or audio files and have the chatbot use that data to answer user questions. For example, if you have a PDF document containing information about your company\'s products or services, the chatbot can use that information to answer questions from potential customers.')
